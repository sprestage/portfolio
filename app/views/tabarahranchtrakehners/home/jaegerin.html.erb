		The choice of a foundation mare is one of the most important that a Trakehner
		breeder can make.  This Canadian born, Abdullah granddaughter was the result
		of careful research for a mare of the old style of Trakehner lines that cross
		so well with the modern Trakehner stallion.  The goal of producing the ideal
		modern Trakehner has been aptly demonstrated in offspring that includes a
		model Trakehner mare (Jaida *M*), and two Trakehner Inspection High Point
		mares (Jädorin and Joriah).
